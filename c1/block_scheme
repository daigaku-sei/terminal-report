Start
├─ Ask user to guess a number
├─ Create an array of random size and elements
│   └─ Collect properties while initializing:
│       ├─ Calculate sum
│       ├─ Calculate product
│       ├─ Track minimum value and its indexes
│       ├─ Track maximum value and its indexes
│       └─ Check if the number is present and track its indexes and count
├─ Did the user guess right?
│    ├─ If true:
│    │     └─ "Lucky guess!"
│    └─ If false:
│          └─ "Better luck next time!"
├─ Print the array
├─ Print the properties (sum, product, minimum, maximum, presence)
│	└─ Calculate and print mean and geometric mean out of sum and product
├─ Search any other number or don't by typing 666 to exit search loop
│ 	└─ Check if the number is present, print its indexes and count
└─ Sort the array with insertions, both ways
